    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or a template that defines the structure and behavior of objects. \n",
    "It is a user-defined data type that encapsulates data (attributes) and functions (methods) that operate on that data. \n",
    "An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class. \n",
    "It represents a specific entity or an instance of the real-world concept defined by the class.\n",

    "The __init__() function in Python is a special method that is automatically called when a new object (instance)\n",
    "of a class is created. It is also known as the constructor method. \n",
    "The primary purpose of the __init__() method is to initialize the attributes (data members) of the object when it is created.\n",
